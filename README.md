# ZdepthLossy - Only Decompression

This Repository contains the code for decompression on windows only

Lossy depth buffer compression designed and tested for Azure Kinect DK.
Based on the Facebook Zstd library and H.264/HEVC for compression.

ZdepthLossy defines a file format and performs full input checking.

Hardware acceleration for H.264/HEVC video compression is leveraged when
possible to reduce CPU usage during encoding and decoding.


## Benchmarks

It runs in ~4 milliseconds and produces compressed lossy depth video at 2.5 Mbps with reasonable quality.

Detailed benchmarks and test vectors available at the end of the document.


## Applications

This is useful as part of a larger real-time volumetric video streaming system
enabled by the Microsoft Azure Kinect DK.  The only data that needs to be sent
for each frame are the compressed depth frames generated by this library,
and the JPEGs from the camera.  The only hope of decoding multiple JPEGs from
multiple cameras in real-time on a Windows laptop is using the nvJPEG library.

The video recorder reads a 16-bit depth image that is compressed with this
library.  These depth images are transmitted to the video player computer over
a network.  The video parameter set must include the calibration data for the
depth sensor.  The video player uses this library to decompress the depth image
and then uses the calibration data to generate xyz, uv, and indices for
rendering the mesh.

Code for quickly regenerating the x,y,z,u,v coordinates and indices is provided
for the Azure Kinect DK in `DepthMesh.hpp`.  It runs in about 3 milliseconds/frame.

If you are looking for other libraries that are useful for making the most of the
Azure Kinect DK, I recommend looking at Intel's Open3D library, which supports
50x faster global point cloud registration than Pointcloud or OpenGR, and Open3D
also has a capture plugin for single cameras.


## Building and Using

Currently requires Windows, an NVidia graphics card, and CUDA v10.1.
If anyone is using this on other platforms please share your code changes back.

There's example usage in the `tests` folder.

This project provides a CMakeLists.txt that generates a `zdepth` target.
Currently the best way to bring this into your project is with a submodule.

Link to the target and include the header:

    #include "zdepth.hpp"

Compress 16-bit depth image to vector of bytes:

    zdepth::DepthCompressor compressor;

    ...

    std::vector<uint8_t> compressed;
    const bool is_keyframe = true;
    compressor.Compress(Width, Height, frame, compressed, is_keyframe);

Re-use the same DepthCompressor object for multiple frames for best performance.

Setting `is_keyframe = false` will use ~2x less bandwidth (e.g. 2.5 Mbps instead of 5 Mbps).
The first frame generated is always a keyframe to allow the decoder to synchronize, since
this frame contains the VPS/SPS/PPS parameter sets for the rest of the video.
Intra-refresh is used where a sweep of macroblocks are recorded at high quality.
Keyframes are IDRs in the video stream.

Decompress vector of bytes back to 16-bit depth image:

    zdepth::DepthCompressor decompressor;

    int width, height;
    std::vector<uint16_t> depth;
    zdepth::DepthResult result = decompressor.Decompress(compressed, width, height, depth);
    if (result != zdepth::DepthResult::Success) {
        // Handle input error
    }

You must use different objects for the compressor and decompressor, or it will fail to decode.


## Lossy versus Lossless

The lossless encoder is in a separate repo here:
https://github.com/catid/Zdepth
The two are split because this lossy version is harder to use.

You may want to compare the quality and size of the output with a
lossless compressor as well before deciding to use the lossy version.

The results vary with the scene.  For the unit test set, the lossless
encoder gets 4-5 Mbps.  The lossy encoder gets 2.5 Mbps with okay quality.
For the 320x288 depth mode of the Azure Kinect DK I would not recommend
setting the bitrate lower than 2 Mbps because quality goes off a cliff.
If this difference is not significant (e.g. streaming just one camera)
then the lossless version may be a decent option.


## Compression Algorithm

    High-level:

        (0) Special case for zero.
            This ensures that the H.264 encoders do not flip zeroes.
        (1) Quantize depth to 11 bits based on sensor accuracy at range.
            Eliminate data that we do not need to encode.
        (2) Rescale the data so that it ranges full-scale from 0 to 2047.
        (3) Compress high 3 bits with Zstd.
        (4) Compress low 8 bits with H.264.

    High 3-bit compression with Zstd:

        (1) Combine 4-bit nibbles together into bytes.
        (2) Encode with Zstd.

    Low 8-bit compression with a video encoder:

        (1) Folding to avoid sharp transitions in the low bits.
            The low bits are submitted to the H.264 encoder, meaning that
            wherever the 8-bit value rolls over it transitions from
            255..0 again.  This sharp transition causes problems for the
            encoder so to solve that we fold every other 8-bit range
            by subtracting it from 255.  So instead the roll-over becomes
            253, 254, 255, 254, 253, ... 1, 0, 1, 2, ...
        (2) Compress the resulting data as an image with a video encoder.
            We use the best hardware acceleration available on the platform.

    Further details are in the DepthCompressor::Filter() code.


## File Format

Format Magic is used to quickly check that the file is of this format.
Words are stored in little-endian byte order.

    struct DepthHeader
    {
        /*  0 */ uint8_t Magic;
        /*  1 */ uint8_t Flags;
        /*  2 */ uint16_t FrameNumber;
        /*  4 */ uint16_t Width;
        /*  6 */ uint16_t Height;
        /*  8 */ uint16_t MinimumDepth;
        /* 10 */ uint16_t MaximumDepth;
        /* 12 */ uint32_t HighUncompressedBytes;
        /* 16 */ uint32_t HighCompressedBytes;
        /* 20 */ uint32_t LowCompressedBytes;
        /* 24 */ uint8_t LowMinimum;
        /* 25 */ uint8_t LowMaximum;
        // Compressed data follows: High bits, then low bits.
    };

The compressed and uncompressed sizes are of packed data for Zstd.

    Flags:
        1 = Keyframe.
        2 = Using H.265 instead of H.264 for video encoding.

For more details on algorithms and format please check out the source code.
Feel free to modify the format for your data to improve the performance.


## Detailed Benchmark Results

The results are from an i9 9900K high end desktop and are not too rigorous.
Using H265 for video encoding.

It seems like the primary advantage of using a video encoder is that
non-keyframes are significantly smaller than the P-frames of my lossless format.
The keyframes are about the same size for both.

The main departure is in losslessly compressing the high bits,
and using a single encoder for the low bits since in practice
having more than one encoder is problematic when recording from
multiple cameras: NVENC only supports two parallel encoders.
